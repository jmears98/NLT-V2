            <h1>No Limit Tactical Release Waiver</h1>
            <p><strong>NO LIMIT TACTICAL RELEASE WAIVER, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK
                    AGREEMENT:</strong></p>
            <p>WHEREAS, in return for instruction in firearms, use of premises and equipment (including but not limited
                to
                firearms and ammunition), and other good and valuable consideration, the Undersigned agrees to the
                following:
            </p>
            <p>To indemnify, hold harmless and defend No Limit Tactical LLC, a limited liability company formed in the
                State of
                Delaware, and any of its members, employees, officers, or agents (collectively, “NLT Staff”) and the
                owners and
                lessees of the Premises (defined below) from any and all fault, liabilities, costs, expenses, claims,
                demands or
                lawsuits (“Claims”) arising out of, related to or connected with: the instruction in or discharge of
                firearms,
                the Undersigned’s participation in discharging firearms; observing the discharging of firearms, the
                range,
                buildings, land and premises used (the “Premises”); the Undersigned’s presence on or use of the
                Premises; the
                equipment (including but not limited to firearms and ammunition); and any and all acts or omissions of
                the
                Undersigned. Should any such Claims arise or be asserted in any way related thereto, whether arising
                under the
                laws of the United States, the State of Pennsylvania or any other state, or under any theory of law or
                equity,
                the Undersigned will indemnify, hold harmless and defend NLT Staff from any and all costs, expenses or
                liability, including but not limited to, the cost of any settlement or judgment made or rendered against
                NLT
                Staff, whether individually, jointly, or in concert with the Undersigned, together with all costs of
                court and
                other costs or expenses incurred, including attorney’s fees, in connection with any such Claims.</p>
            <p>The Undersigned waives any and all rights and claims for damages, losses, demand and any other actions,
                which
                exist or which may arise against NLT Staff and owners and lessees of the Premises (including but not
                limited to
                any and all injuries, damages or illnesses suffered by the Undersigned or the Undersigned’s property)
                which may
                in any way whatsoever arise out of, be related to or be connected with: instruction in or discharging
                firearms;
                the use of NLT Staff equipment (including but not limited to firearms and ammunition); the Premises,
                including
                any latent defects in the Premises; the Undersigned’s presence on or use of the Premises; the
                Undersigned’s
                property (whether or not entrusted to NLT Staff). NLT Staff shall not be liable for, and the Undersigned
                hereby
                expressly releases NLT Staff from any and all such claims. This waiver is both personal and on behalf of
                any
                minor for whom it is executed.</p>
            <p>The Undersigned expressly assumes the risk of entering the Premises and taking part in activities on the
                Premises
                which include, but are not limited to the discharge of firearms and the firing of live ammunition;
                observing
                individuals discharging firearms; the use of NLT Staff equipment (including but not limited to firearms
                and
                ammunition); and the use of the Premises. The Undersigned furthermore hereby acknowledges and agrees
                that he/she
                has read, understands and will at all times abide by NLT Staff’s rules, instructions, procedures, safety
                rules
                and any and all Range Officer instructions, whether communicated in writing, posted on the premises or
                communicated verbally. This instrument binds the Undersigned and his/her executors, administrators,
                assignees or
                heirs and any minor for whom it is signed. If obviously under the age of 21, my age is listed. If I am a
                minor
                under the age of 18 years, I understand that a parent or legal guardian’s signature is required.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that the use of firearms is an inherently dangerous activity and assume the risks of using
                and
                employing firearms or other similar products on the Premises.</p>
            <p>I further acknowledge that the study and application of firearms techniques is physically demanding and
                requires
                that I be in good physical condition and free of any disability or physical condition that would
                prohibit my
                participation.</p>
            <p>By signing this waiver and agreement, you are acknowledging that you have read, understand and agree with
                the
                above and verifying that you are a U.S. citizen at least 18 years old and can legally own, use and
                possess a
                firearm in accordance with all local, state and federal laws of the United States of America.</p>
            <p>I hereby warrant that I am a legally competent adult and a parent or legally appointed guardian of the
                minor, and
                that I have every right to contract for the minor in the above regard. I further state that I have read
                this
                waiver and agreement, prior to its execution, and that I fully understand and agree to the contents
                thereof.
                This waiver and agreement shall be binding upon the minor and me, and our respective heirs, legal
                representatives and assigns.</p>
